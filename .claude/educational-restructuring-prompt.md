# Educational Content Restructuring Prompt

## Context

This prompt is designed for restructuring raw educational materials (transcripts, PDFs, ZIP demos) into comprehensive, well-organized learning modules with progressive tutorials, following an iterative quality improvement process.

## Educational Material Restructuring Workflow

### Objective
To iteratively refine and improve educational materials through a structured process of expert critique, implementation, and quality assurance.

### Roles
- **Author**: The initial creator of the educational content
- **Senior Data Analyst (Reviewer)**: Provides expert critique and suggestions for improvement
- **Implementer**: Applies the suggested changes to the material
- **Quality Assurance (QA)**: Provides a final sign-off on the quality of the material

### Workflow Steps

#### Phase 1: Initial Review Cycle
1. **Initial Material**: Complete draft of educational content
2. **Senior Analyst Review**: Expert evaluates accuracy, clarity, flow, and technical depth
3. **Generate Initial Critique**: Feedback compiled into structured `notes for improvement.md`
4. **Implement Changes**: Revise material based on initial feedback
5. **Update Material**: Apply improvements to educational content

#### Phase 2: Iterative Improvement Loop
6. **Quality Check**: Assess if content meets educational standards
7. **Re-review (if needed)**: Senior analyst conducts additional review cycles
8. **Continuous Refinement**: Multiple iterations until quality standards are met
9. **Append Feedback**: All review cycles documented in notes file

#### Phase 3: Quality Assurance Cycle  
10. **QA Review**: Final quality assurance evaluation
11. **QA Iteration**: Minor revisions if needed (separate from content review)
12. **QA Sign-off**: Final certification when all standards are met
13. **Document Certification**: QA statement appended to notes
14. **Approved Material**: Final, approved educational content ready for use

**Key Feature**: The process includes **two distinct iteration loops**:
- **Content Improvement Loop**: Between steps 6-9 for subject matter refinement
- **QA Loop**: Between steps 10-12 for final quality certification

## The Task

**Objective:** Transform raw educational content into a structured learning experience with hands-on tutorials that progress from foundational understanding to practical application.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Phase 1: Content Analysis and Cleanup

1. **Examine the current structure** of the educational folder
2. **Remove transcript files** (TXT, VTT files) while preserving PDF slides and practical demonstrations  
3. **Extract and analyze ZIP demos** to understand the content and learning objectives
4. **Preserve PDF slides** as reference materials alongside tutorials
5. **Create a main README.md** that provides comprehensive theoretical foundation

### Phase 2: Structured README Creation

Create a comprehensive module README.md that includes:

#### Content Structure

- **Overview with process flow diagram** (Mermaid)
- **Data preparation section** explaining preprocessing steps with examples
- **Step-by-step conceptual progression** (e.g., Step 1: Concept A, Step 2: Concept B)
- **Key definitions and formulas** with clear explanations
- **Algorithm explanations with flowcharts** (Mermaid diagrams)
- **Metrics and evaluation criteria** with relationship diagrams
- **Business applications** with real-world examples and diagrams
- **Practical challenges and considerations** with decision trees
- **Modern applications and business value**

#### Visual Enhancements

- **Process flow diagrams** showing the overall workflow
- **Algorithm flowcharts** demonstrating step-by-step processes
- **Metrics relationship diagrams** showing how calculations connect
- **Business application maps** illustrating real-world uses
- **Threshold impact visualizations** showing trade-offs

### Phase 3: Progressive Tutorial Development

Create numbered tutorials in logical learning order:

#### Tutorial Naming Convention

- `00-manual-calculation-tutorial/` - **Foundation level**
- `01-[concept-name]-tutorial/` - **Basic implementation**  
- `02-[advanced-concept]-tutorial/` - **Advanced applications**

#### Tutorial Structure for Each

- **Comprehensive README.md** with:
  - Learning objectives
  - Prerequisites  
  - Step-by-step tutorial structure
  - Key concepts explained
  - Expected outputs
  - Next steps
- **Interactive Jupyter notebook** with working examples
